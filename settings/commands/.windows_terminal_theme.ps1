#     Hello!
    
#     There's a bit of a problem, but there's an easy fix!
    
#     Powershell has an issue with colors
#     The issue has been posted here for several years
#     https://github.com/microsoft/Terminal/issues/23
#     (Please go complain so they will finally fix it)
#     As far as I know, there's still no way to fix it from a program
    
#     If you could
#     1. Go to the top bar of this powershell
#     2. Right click and then select 'Properties'
#     3. Go to the 'colors' tab
#     4. Select 'Screen Background'
#     5. Select the black color (far left)
#     6. Then click 'OK'
    
#     That will prevent the screen from turning purple later on
#     [press enter to continue]"
    
#     if (-not $host.ui.rawui.backgroundcolor.equals([System.ConsoleColor]::Black)) {
#         Clear-Host
#         read-host "it appears the setting as still not changed
#         [press enter to continue]"
#     }
# }
# Clear-Host

# 
# Set Color Theme
