(using_atk_version): 1.1.0

todo:
    - create fully synchronous version (branch?):
        - pull latest video frame
        - run model
        - run aim
    - change the main.DockerFile into a slimed down version:
        - only have python and its dependencies basically
    - explore the idea of having pre-set firing locations:
        - get a way for the robot to know where it is
        - fire in paths where robots are expected
