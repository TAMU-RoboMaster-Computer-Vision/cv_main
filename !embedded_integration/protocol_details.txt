Embedded Integration Protocol

----------------------- CRC Echo ---------------------------------
This function can be used to identify the serial port assigned
to the DJI board. The host sends 16 bytes of random data to
the board and then expects the CRC32 checksum of the concatenation
of the random data and the string "TAMU RoboMasters". The host
will additionally calculate the checksum on its own, and if
the 4 bytes received from the board matches the checksum
calculated by the host, the host can be confident it is talking
to the board and not some other serial device.

Origin | Size  |  Data
 Host  |  1    |  Command ID (ID=5)
 Host  |  16   |  Random data
 Board |  4    |  crc32([Random data] + "TAMU RoboMasters")

--------------------- String Echo --------------------------------
Echo a string from the board back to the host.

Origin | Size  |  Data
 Host  |  1    |  Command ID (ID=10)
 Host  |  4    |  String length (n)
 Host  |  n    |  String contents
 Board |  n    |  String contents
