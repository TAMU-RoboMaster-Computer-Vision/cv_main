# summary
#   this is a nuclear cleaning option 
#   - if its not part of the git repo
#   - and it will take a long time (>1min) to get the data back
#   => this command should get rid of it
#   useful when you're trying to reset a project back to 0 when debugging

# clean all the small things
./commands/clean

# all the virtual env pip modules (several minutes to rebuild these)
